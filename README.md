This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript related to implicit type coercion. The `add` function is declared to accept two numbers, but it's called with a string and a number.  While TypeScript's type system will catch this during development if you use strict type checking (noImplicitAny), JavaScript's loose typing means the code will still run, leading to unexpected behavior.  The solution shows how to prevent this issue by using strict type checking or explicit type assertions.
